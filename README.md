# Lab 3 â€” Developing with Bootstrap

## Overview

In this lab I refactored two earlieer Frontend Mentor projects using Bootstrap.
1. The QR Code Component
2. The Blog Preview Card

The goal was to replace most of the custom CSS with Bootstrap's utility classes, grid system, and components keeping the layout and design close to the original.

This Lab helped me building responsive layouts, and understanding how Bootstrap simplifies the styling.
